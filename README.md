## uib-end-of-module-project ##

In this project I will design and build a simple portfolio website for architect Abdelmonem Ibrahim. I am keeping the design very simple so that I can focus on keeping the layout and code clean and adding simple features to the website. 

*Preparation*

I have been working on a website for Abdelmonem Ibrahim since the beginning of the course, but to begin with in order to achieve his design ideas I was following tutorials from Youtube without understanding what the code did yet. For the project I wanted to do something very simple so that I could focus on the images, but my previous work meant that I had an idea of the site's structure in my head. 

I tried to draw out a basic template for the website in Figma but I definitely need to practise with the site a bit more- I don't find its UI very intuitive and was worried that it would take me a long time to get anything done and that this would frontload my project with frustration, so I let Figma go, knowing that the design I had in my head was quite simple. I will definitely spend some time getting to grips with it soon though, as not having a mockup to work from means that I spend a lot of time fiddling about with proportions in code. 


*Coding Process*

## SCSS ##

I wanted to get use to working in SCSS as soon as possible. I won't say I regret this but it definitely made things a little slower than I would have liked, mainly because the process of seperating out sections of code into different files will make it a little more difficult to find errors and clashes until I'm used to checking multiple files alongside each other. 

## animation and frustrated ambitions ##

It very quickly became apparent that I wasn't going to get a finished product in the time allotted- even with the site's pages following a very similar design, it was better to focus on the main landing page and the contact page, as that included a form. I had intended to do an animation using the four images on the computational design page- and still intend that!- but had to postpone that for the moment. 

## responsiveness ##

Because the site is more image- focussed than text it made sense to me to start with the desktop design and then write media queries for the tablet view . However, I am going to try to code mobile first from now on, as I think it's much easier to write complexity in than to simplify complexity out. At the point at which I stopped coding I was struggling to move my social media icons from the footer to the header with a media query, so media queries are definitely something I understand in my head but struggle to make work. I'm also very aware of the things I understand about flex box in theory but find difficult in practise, and this project was no different- lots of trying to target the item instead of the container and so forth.
